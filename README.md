# Godot Engine

**[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.**

Please look upstream for more information.

## Fork

This is [cat](https://github.com/Yukitty)'s stable branch, currently based on
Godot 3.2

No new features are being accepted for Godot 3.X at the time of this writing,
and Godot 4.0 is not yet stable, so you may think of this branch as my own
unofficial "Godot 3.3" update in the meantime.

I prefer to build my features in GDScript when possible, so only critical
engine upgrades will appear here.

## Local features

* Backport of the physical scancode keyboard input feature that was merged
into Godot 4.0 (untested)
* An integer stretch mode for the 2D renderer. (clean pixel art)
